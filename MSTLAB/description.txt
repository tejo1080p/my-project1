This project is a simple React application that displays a list of movies.

Each movie has a title, genre, and rating, stored in a separate movies.js file.

The app renders the movies as cards using a reusable MovieCards component.

Each card displays the movie details in a clean, styled layout.

A Delete button is provided on each card to remove the movie from the list dynamically.

The app uses React state (useState) to manage the list of movies.

Deleting a movie updates the UI immediately without refreshing the page.

The project is built using Vite for fast development and hot reloading.

It demonstrates component-based architecture and props passing in React.

This project is suitable for beginners to learn React fundamentals and state management.
